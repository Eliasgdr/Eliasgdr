# Elias GaudarÃ©

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Elias GaudarÃ©, a passionate 2nd-year computer engineering student at CY-Tech near Paris. I strive to craft clean and readable code, believing that clarity is key for both present and future collaborators. I'm a firm believer that more comments are better than fewer, and I name my variables and functions with precision and meaning.

## ðŸš€ Projects
Here are some of my latest projects:

### [Image Manipulation (C)](https://github.com/DonatienLinossier/TraitementImageC)
A project where my teammates and I explored the intricacies of image manipulation using the C programming language. From basic transformations to more advanced filters, I delved into the fascinating world of digital image processing.

### [2D Elastic Simulation (C++)](https://github.com/Eliasgdr/Simulation2D)
In this project, I implemented a 2D elastic simulation using C++. The simulation showcased my proficiency in both theoretical understanding and practical application of physics concepts in programming. The result? A visually engaging and accurate elastic simulation that can support thousands of objects in real time.

## ðŸŒ± Next Project
Currently, I'm diving into the exciting world of 3D rendering, building a simple 3D renderer in C++ with SDL, focusing on 3D transformations, perspective projection, and efficient rendering techniques.

## ðŸ¤” Interests
While I have a budding interest in visual computing and graphics programming, I'm still exploring the vast landscape of computer engineering. My preferences aren't set in stone, and I'm open to discovering new and exciting areas within the field.
